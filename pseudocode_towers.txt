Keep three arrays, which represents the piles of discs.
Pick a representation of the discs to store in the arrays; maybe just a number representing their size.
Don't worry too much about making the user interface pretty.

In a loop, prompt the user (using gets) and ask what pile to select a disc from, and where to put it.

After each move, check to see if they have succeeded in moving all the discs, to the final pile. If so, they win!



set constructor function
  set stack ivar to array of three arrays
promptMove print stacks
promptMove asks user where to move to and from
promptMove store startTowerIdx and endTowerIdx
isValidMove checks if startTowerIdx can go on top of eTIdx
move performs move if valid
move return true or false depending if something moves
print stacks
isWon checks if all discs move on new stack
run method:
prompts move from user
in callback run move
print error if fails
run again if not Won
otherwise, print user has won and run completion callback
